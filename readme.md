Use Angular, a popular front-end Web-development framework, to develop a more advanced and dynamic version of markdown editor client. The implementation in Project 3 will save all blog posts created by the user locally within the browser, without any interaction with the server. In Project 4, you will then implement the server-side code, on Node.js and Express, to store and publish the user's posts online. Combined together, you will go through a full-stack Web-development cycle on the MEAN stack, an approach popular among many Web start-ups today.
